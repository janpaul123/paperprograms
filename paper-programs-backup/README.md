This directory is used as a location to store snapshots of the paper programs in GitHub.  The programs are stored in a
shared database, but that database is vulnerable to corruption.  Maintaining periodic snapshots of the programs will
allow the team to restore them if ever they are lost, to more easily refactor them, and to see their history (though
individual edit histories won't be available).
