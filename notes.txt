If you get an error about the server: pg_ctl -D "C:\Program Files\PostgreSQL\9.6\data" stop

Had to go into windows services by running "Services"
    Search for postgresql-x64-15 and make sure the services is running

I ended up reinstalling postgres after getting an error like
"Is the server running?"
