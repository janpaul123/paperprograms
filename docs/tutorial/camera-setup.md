## Camera Parameters optimization: 
You are looking for dots to be stably detected, might need switch between this and the next step.
- TURN OFF Auto on: Zoom, Exposure, White Balance
- Adjust Exposure to see papers clearly (not too dark)
- Adjust: Zoom (clearest text)
- Adjust White Balance (make sure blacks look black, and not blue or green)
- (optional) Adjust contrast (can probably go to max)
- (optional) Raise Sharpness if edges look fuzzy

## Calibrate dots 
Decide if you need to make anymore camera parameter changes.
