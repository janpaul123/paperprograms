## Local installation
Make sure to have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org) and [PostgreSQL](https://postgresql.org) installed first. Checkout the repo and run in a terminal:

```sh
npm install
npm run dev
```

This will create a new database, and start all necessary processes. Then go to [localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to get started.
